## Rescue-Yours Proposal  
	"You can't change an animal's past, but you could rewrite their future"
	Rescue-Yours is our attempt at making a simple rescue pet finding application using an inputed location.
	A user will theoretically be able to input a location and pick from a drop down list of animals
	Once their results show, they can view the details of an animal and save them to their favorites. 
	A user will be able to upload and delete their own comments on their favorite animals.
